			margin-top:70px;">When I was in primary school, my father bought me a computer. QQ was my first social software. Its
                affiliate product, the QQ zone, is a blog-like feature. You can post your first mood in it, or write a
                journal you can show others. I prefer its game features because you can play some early Java engine web
                games. QQ farm and QQ ranch are the main game I usually play, because you can personally feel the fun of
                growing crops and raising animals.

            <div class="parki">
                QQ Parking

            <p style="color:#C773EA;margin-left:15px;width:500px;
			margin-top:240px;">The other two games that were very popular at the time were qq parking and qq pet, qq parking is
                a game where you can buy a car, and then you can park in your car and other people's car, to make money,
                and then you can buy a better car. The best part of the game is that you can grab each other's parking
                Spaces. So keep your eyes on the clock and don't let your friends steal your parking space. At that
                time, this game is a kind of science car game. QQ pet is a simulated pet penguin game, your penguin is
                your pet, you have to take care of it, or it will be sad or depressed, and eventually die. In my
                opinion, this game is the enlightenment game of my love for small animals. It has cultivated my sense of
                responsibility and respect for pets.

            <p class="when">When I was young, qqzone was the social network I contacted. The website design of qqzone
                has become my early aesthetic, while qqzone has some very human design, that is, you can customize some
                of your pages. And this is also the first web design I came into contact with.
