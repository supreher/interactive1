        <h2>Conversation</h2>
        <p>Q: What is "good" screen-based design?</p>
        <p>A: A clear page that can make people focus on what the designer wants
             the audience to see. <br> &#8195; And also interesting and attractive especially
              when the content is more academically. 
            </p>
       
            <p>Q: How is 90-making online different then art-making offline?</p>
             <p>A: Making art online is different than offline is the hierarchy. 
            Which when making art offline, <br>&#8195; people can ignore the hierarchy a little than focusing on the contents. 
            Art making online needs <br>&#8195; more attention for hierarchy is because a messy page will distract the audience and will lose interests.
            </p>

            <p>Q: What do you think is the ‘purpose’ of the web?</p>
            <p>A: Depends on what information you want to present.   </p>

            <p>Q: How has your view of the internet?</p>
            <p>A: During the old days, internet did not have much information than nowadays, 
            you can easily <br>&#8195; collect infos you want to know by just sitting in front of your computer or you phone. </p>

            <p>Q: How does the web impact graphic design?</p>
            <p>A: As I mentioned earlier, when internet did not have a system of running it, 
                graphic design was <br>&#8195; only drawing on paper than can work online now. </p>

            <p>Q: What will screen based design grow in the future? </p>
            <p>A: It depends on how much more possibilities of internet grows,
                 that there can happens more <br>&#8195; and more different ways of designing.</p>

            <p>Q: What do you think internet will grow in future?</p>
            <p>A: I hope in the future, that internet can become something that needy for everyone either <br>&#8195; the person has 
                the ability to access it or does not able to access it. It can be fair situation <br>&#8195; for everybody
                 no matter the social status. </p>
